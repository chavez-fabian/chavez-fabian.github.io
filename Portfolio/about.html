<p>
 My lifeâ€™s public objective is to be a voice for the shy conservatives, republicans, 
    and libertarians in the LGBT community, as well as encourage diversity of opinion 
    instead of diversity of looks or sexuality inside STEM. I wish to get a PHD in hardware
    or software engineering, and live independently and disconnect from my immediete family. 
    I personally believe in a free market and open trade, and small gov but rule of law. 
    I am also a Trump supporter and believe that he is one of the most effective and free-thinking
    presidents in our time. MAGA!
